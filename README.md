# Grep Youtube Pull

Downloads the index page from Youtube using "wget -O index.html url_here". Then creates a text file for each value: user, views, time (duration), id, title. Also, constructs a text table with five columns each for a value previously specified. Uses only grep, expr, cut and paste commands with loops.
